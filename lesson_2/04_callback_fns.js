// CALLBACK FUNCTIONS!!

// FIRST CLASS OBJECTS
// primitives, arrays, objects AND FUNCTIONS are all "first class objects"
// we can use them for stuff, elements in objects, args to function, return value of fn

// HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
// functions that take or return other functions

// imperative vs declarative: 
// imperative, explain every step
// declarative, "i declare that I want to map each element..."
